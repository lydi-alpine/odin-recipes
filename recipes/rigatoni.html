    <h1>Rigatoni</h1>

    <img src="../images/rigatoni.jpg">

        <p>This recipe is our weeknight adaptation of the pasta fresca con carciofi e pecorino that we tasted in Bari, Italy. 
        The flavors are bright and fresh, and the prep is a breeze (chopping the basil is as arduous as it gets here).</p>
         Be sure to purchase jarred marinated artichoke hearts—they offer much more flavor than canned or frozen. 

         <p>You will need three 12-ounce jars to get the 3 cups drained artichokes called for. 
         The hearts usually are halved or quartered; there’s no need to chop them after draining, as they will break apart during cooking.</p>
